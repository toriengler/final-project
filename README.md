Overview:
Hershey Park is a popular theme park in Hershey, Pennsylvania. For my project, I used this park's website, HersheyPark.com, to scrape and crawl information about the park's address, rides and their ratings, springtime dates and their operating hours.

must include:
- Data sources used, including instructions for a user to access the data sources (e.g., API keys or client secrets needed, along with a pointer to instructions on how to obtain these and instructions for how to incorporate them into your program (e.g., secrets.py file format))
- Any other information needed to run the program (e.g., pointer to getting started info for plotly)
- Brief description of how your code is structured, including the names of significant data processing functions (just the 2-3 most important functions--not a complete list) and class definitions. If there are large data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries) that you create to organize your data for presentation, briefly describe them.
- Brief user guide, including how to run the program and how to choose presentation options.
